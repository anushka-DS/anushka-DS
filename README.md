- ðŸ˜„ Words that describe me - *Self-motivated, Data-enthusiast, Cosmophile, Focused, Hardworking, Story-teller, Enthusiast, Ambitious*

<h3>Machine learning, as a domain has always been one of my favorites. I have been actively researching and making several ML models, since 2017. I am more interested in Computer Vision, Transformers and RNNs and how they work with different libraries and algorithms to make wonders. I have hands on experience working with GANs, Gesture Recognition, Sentiment Analysis and Recommender engines.<h3>

<h4>Apart from making applications, I also like Data Analysis. It always surprises me how a little amount of data can give so much information. They are the best story tellers. Kaggle is my go to place for data exploration. I use python for my EDA projects. Some of the platforms I like to use are Kaggle notebooks, Jupyter Lab and Google Colab.<h4>


<h4>Machine Learning Enthusiast | Deep Learning | Data Analyst | Python/Java Developer | DevOps | MLOps .</h4>
<h4>To utilize my knowledge and ideas in this field of machine learning, web development and embedded system toward the smooth functioning of organization,I realised that, satisfaction is a book of achievement, which holds the learning experience records of doing, trying, twiddling, exploring, unlearning and learning again and finally succeeding in the project.</h4>

âš¡ Fun facts -  *Less than 0.5% of all data we create is ever analysed and used.*
  
                 Google uses about 1,000 computers to answer every single search query.
  
                 Nearly 80% of photos are taken on smart phones and most will become searchable data online.
  
                 Data Science Needs Great Communication, Analytical and Story-telling Skills.
  
                 75% of Data Experts use Python for Data Science Work.
  
                 Data Science is at the crossroads of Computer IT, Mathematics & Statistics and Domain expertise.
